								About me:
							</p>
							<p>
								I have since taken my upper secondary education In Game programming from LBS södra (Ljud och bild skolan stockholm)
								and continued my education In Futuregames programming 2019.
							</p>
								I always had a ambition to try out new ideas or challenge old ones both in regard to programming and general life. 
								In that sense i have taken liking to exploring new ideas within game development, programming or anything else that could be a benefit to myself or others. 
								<p> 
									My interests in games started from childhood and got my introduction to game development from my bother in late elemtry school, he let me take part QE sessions or play early some builds. 
									Early on the idea of doing code as a dyslectic med me reconsider my career choice but fighting through  it have given me more fire to challenge new projects and i have become more confident in my skills and ambitions.
								</p>
								<p>
									I have snice then starting to explore som more indepth subjects regarding graphics API's and system architecture.
									My main areas of interests in regard of programming is game tools, game mechanics, graphics and the occasional dip in to Ai.
								</p>
								
								Other areas of interests outside of my profession are, Nutrition/Exersice science and Computer Hardware.
